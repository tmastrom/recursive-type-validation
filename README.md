# Sandbox for recursive type validation

This project compares Typescript with [Typebox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox) and [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for validating recursive type schemas.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To test:

```bash
bun test
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.26. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
